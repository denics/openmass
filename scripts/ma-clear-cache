#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# Description:
# This bash script aims at clearing the cached twig on individual webservers on massgov's Acquia Cloud environment. Currently, this is a known issue and is tracked under CL-13461 where cached Twig templates fall out of sync on different web server instances when changes to themes are being made and a code deployment has been performed. The script loops through a list of webservers, which can grow by adding more to the for loop below using space as a delimiter. The code below relies on having the user/machine's public key on the Acquia Cloud. Return code of each command is captured to verify if the task ran successfully (green text output) or not (red text output).
