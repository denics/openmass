# define custom search suppression module routes.

# In order to to create pages it is necessary to define routes for them.
# A route maps a URL path to a controller. It defines what function
# or method will be called when a URL is accessed.
# If the user accesses "admin/config/custom/mass-search-suppression/settings",
# the routing system will look for a route with that path. In this case it will
# find a match, and execute the _controller callback. In this case the callback
# is defined as a class name ("\Drupal\mass_search_suppression\Form\SettingsForm").
mass_search_suppression.admin_settings:
  path: 'admin/config/mass-search-suppression/settings'
  defaults:
    _form:  '\Drupal\mass_search_suppression\Form\SettingsForm'
    _title: 'Mass Header Search Suppression'
  requirements:
    _permission: 'administer site content'
