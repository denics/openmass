# mass.gov
## The official website of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts

## Requirements

* VMWare, or [virtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) >= 5.0
* [vagrant](http://downloads.vagrantup.com/) >= 1.8
* [ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) `brew install ansible`  (This is not possible on Windows host machines, but there is a workaround.)
* [vagrant-hostmanager](https://github.com/smdahlen/vagrant-hostmanager) `vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostmanager`
* [vagrant-auto_network](https://github.com/oscar-stack/vagrant-auto_network) `vagrant plugin install vagrant-auto_network`
* [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [composer](https://getcomposer.org/)


If you have been running a previous version of Vagrant you may need to do: `vagrant plugin update` to ensure that you can install the plugins.

## Required Set Up
Before you can install the site, you'll need to make sure that you have access to the Acquia environment so you can download the canonical database. Once you have access to the environment, please follow these steps:

1. Log in to your Acquia account
1. Navigate to the "Credentials" tab under your profile
1. Under the "Drush Integration" heading, click the "Download Drush aliases" link
1. This will download acquiacloud.tar.gz
1. Unzip this archive
1. Place the resulting directory within this project's "artifacts" directory (create it if it doesn't exist)
1. You should now have your Acquia Cloud credentials available at "${build.dir}/artifacts/acquiacloud" (which will have two subdirectories: .acquia and .drush)

*If you don't have access to Acquia and would like to install with a clean database, you can call `phing clean-install` instead of `install` anywhere phing would try to do an install for you. If so, you must run the `migrate` task as well. *

## Getting Started

1. From inside the project root, run:
 * `composer install`
 * `vagrant up`
1. You will be prompted for the administration password on your host machine. Obey.
1. SSH in and install the site:

  ```
    vagrant ssh
    cd /var/www/mass.local
    vendor/bin/phing build install migrate
  ```

3. Visit [mass.local](http://mass.local) in your browser of choice.

## How do I work on this?

1. From inside the project root, type `vagrant ssh`
1. Navigate to `/var/www/mass.local`
1. Build, install: `vendor/bin/phing build install`
1. Test: `vendor/bin/phing test`
1. phing and drush tasks should be run from within the VM (using `vendor/bin/phing` and `vendor/bin/drush`).
1. Git and composer tasks should be run from your host machine.

If you must run `composer` and `git` commands from within the VM make sure you configure your name and email for proper attribution, and [configure your global .gitignore](https://github.com/palantirnet/development_documentation/blob/master/guidelines/git/gitignore.md):

```
git config --global user.email 'me@palantir.net'
git config --global user.name 'My Name'
```

## How do I Drupal?

### The Drupal root

This project uses [Composer Installers](https://github.com/composer/installers), [DrupalScaffold](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-scaffold), and [the-build](https://github.com/palantirnet/the-build) to assemble our Drupal root in `web`. Dig into `web` to find the both contrib Drupal code (installed by composer) and custom Drupal code (included in the git repository).

### Using drush

You can run `drush` commands from anywhere within the repository, as long as you are ssh'ed into the vagrant.

### Installing and reinstalling Drupal

Run `composer install` from your host machine and `vendor/bin/phing build install` within the VM.
You should normally ignore messages from composer about an outdate composer.lock file.

### Configure Composer with OAuth Token
* Go to [GitHub Settings - Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
* If setting up a new Token, make the scope just for the repo
* Once you have completed creating the token, add it to your composer config `composer config -g github-oauth.github.com <oauthtoken>`

### Adding modules

* Complete "__Configure Composer with OAuth Token__" first
* Download modules with composer: `composer require drupal/bad_judgement:^8.1`
* Enable the module: `drush en bad_judgement`
* Export the config with the module enabled: `drush config-export`
* Commit the changes to `composer.json`, `composer.lock`, and `conf/drupal/config/core.extension.yml`. The module code itself will be excluded by the project's `.gitignore`.

### Patching modules

Sometimes we need to apply patches from the Drupal.org issue queues. These patches should be applied using composer using the [Composer Patches](https://github.com/cweagans/composer-patches) composer plugin.

### Configuring Drupal settings.php

Sometimes it is appropriate to configure specific Drupal variables in Drupal's `settings.php` file. Our `settings.php` file is built from a template found at `conf/drupal/settings.php` during the phing build.

* Add your appropriately named values to `conf/build.default.properties` (like `drupal.my_setting=example`)
* Update `conf/drupal/settings.php` to use your new variable (like `$conf['my_setting'] = '${drupal.my_setting}';`)
* Run `vendor/bin/phing build`
* Test
* If the variable requires different values in different environments, add those to the appropriate properties files (`conf/build.vagrant.properties`, `conf/build.circle.properties`, `conf/build.acquia.properties`). Note that you may reference environment variables with `drupal.my_setting=${env.DRUPAL_MY_SETTING}`.
* Finally, commit your changes.

### Adding or altering configuration

Many features will require edits to site configuration, such as adding new content types or altering the configuration of fields.  When you commit your changes, you must be careful only to add or edit the configuration you intend to alter.  This is made difficult by the fact that not all of the site's configuration is stored in code. 
* After performing a `drush config-export` NEVER perform a `git add .` or a `git add conf/drupal*`
* All changes to config yml files should be added carefully and individually.
* Suggested approach to make this process a bit easier:
   * Before starting work, `drush config-export` so you have a clean baseline (`phing install` has already imported the configuration that is being tracked in code).
   * Do any configuration changes needed, run tests.
   * Review (and perhaps copy or screenshot) Drupal's helpful list of the changes you have made to configuration at /admin/config/development/configuration
   * Run `drush config-export` again.
   * With your list in hand, add config files to your branch interactively, using git add -i, or tools provided by your IDE.

## How do I run tests?

### Behat

Run `vendor/bin/phing test` or `vendor/bin/behat features/installation.feature`.

## Deployment

[Deploying a local install to Acquia DEV](docs/deploy.md)

## Troubleshooting

### DNS could not be found

If, on browsing to `http://mass.local`, you get the following error:
> mass.localâ€™s server DNS address could not be found.

Then `vagrant up` may have failed half way through. When this happens, the `vagrant-hostmanager` plugin does not add the hostname to `/etc/hosts`. Try halting and re-upping the machine: `vagrant halt && vagrant up`. Reload is not sufficient to trigger updating the hosts file.

### Could not build, phing error

If you try to build the site and get a phing saying the Drupal site could not be built, but you were recently building it successfully, you may need to run `composer install`. If you switch branches and the new branch has a composer dependency that you don't have installed on your branch, phing complains loudly.
